Tailwind CSS has changed how developers build UI components through its utility-first CSS framework, enabling developers to build modern interfaces through composable utility classes rather than traditional CSS. Its approach eliminates the need to write custom CSS while maintaining complete control over your design system.

Its innovative approach to styling has made Tailwind popular among teams seeking to streamline their development process while maintaining design flexibility.

Why use Tailwind CSS?
Rapid development: By using utility classes directly in HTML, developers can build interfaces faster without context-switching between CSS files
Responsive design: Built-in responsive utilities make it easy to create mobile-first layouts without writing media queries
Customization: Tailwind’s configuration system allows teams to define their design system while maintaining consistency
Performance: Through its purge system, Tailwind generates minimal CSS by removing unused utility classes
While Tailwind CSS offers remarkable flexibility, writing repetitive utility classes for common components can become tedious. This is where component libraries come in — they provide pre-built, customizable components that leverage Tailwind’s utility classes while maintaining its flexibility.

In this guide, we’ll explore 13 of the best free and open source Tailwind CSS component libraries currently available, comparing their features, use cases, and integration options.

1. Preline UI

Preline UI provides a rich collection of 300+ prebuilt Tailwind CSS components. It has also 160+ starter pages and examples you can use to speed up the development process. It also offers the largest Figma-free design system with tons of bells and whistles.
With Preline UI, there are components for building layouts, navigations, forms, and other base components such as alerts, buttons, cards, and more. On top of that, there is also a set of Tailwind CSS plugins not included in the core framework, such as accordions, tabs, dropdowns, and modals.
Preline UI has specific installation guides for most of the major frontend frameworks and additional docs for customization, theming, and dark mode support.
In short, Preline UI is a full-featured, modern-looking library suitable for building mobile-first websites and apps. However, it might not be suitable for very simple or very complex projects.

2. Ripple UI

Ripple UI is another great library for building modern interfaces. It provides a rich set of components and utilities. You can install Ripple UI as a plugin via the package manager of your choice or by including it as a CDN link. It also provides starter project examples for many popular frontend frameworks like Vue, React, Svelte, and others.
Ripple UI comes with a default theme that you can use right away, but if you need something different, you can create, modify, and remove your custom themes. It also comes with automatic support for dark mode.
Basically, Ripple UI offers classes like Bootstrap, but with the flexibility of Tailwind CSS. It’s great for projects requiring a modern look/feel with a full set of components.
However, if you need something simpler — like a couple of components to quickly inject into your project — then some of the component library options below might be more suitable than Ripple UI.

Sira is great for projects requiring a modern look along with a full set of components for building simple to intermediate apps. But as with the Ripple UI library, if you need something simpler — for example, just a couple of simple components — then it might not be the best option.

4. Tailwind Elements

Tailwind Elements is a huge set of more than 500 UI components. These components range from very simple — like headings, images, and icons — to very complex, like charts and complete forms. They can be used for almost any kind of project, especially for complex ones.
You can also use Tailwind Elements design blocks like articles, hero sections, mega menus, testimonials, features, stats, and others for more complex scenarios.
The documentation for Tailwind Elements is very detailed, with instructions for installing, configuring, and optimizing your Tailwind CSS project, as well as for customization and theming. It also offers integration guides for major frontend frameworks, including Angular, React, Svelte, and Vue.
Tailwind Elements has a simple, powerful, and easy-to-use API that allows you to fully customize the components according to your needs and requirements. It uses a design system called Material Minimal, which is a modified version of Material Design with a more elegant and unique look and feel.
The only reason you might not want to use Tailwind Elements for a particular project is if your project is especially simple. Then you may be better off skipping all the installation and preparation steps necessary for using Tailwind Elements and choosing something simpler from this list.

5. Mamba UI

To use Sailboat UI components in your project, you just need to copy, paste, and customize the code for the components you want. The library is great as a foundation of well-styled components, but if you need something more customized and modern-looking, then I recommend picking another option from this list.

To use the components, simply copy and paste them into your project, then customize them according to your needs. For some of the dynamic components — like dropdowns — you will also need Alpine.js.

Using Tailwind Starter Kit is as easy as copying and pasting the code for the components you want to use in your Tailwind CSS project — no complex installation is required. You only need to combine the different components to build your desired pages.
This kit also provides several starter sample pages to start your project even faster and easier. As they claim, the documentation is built by developers, for developers, making it easy to navigate and use.
With Tailwind Starter Kit, you can change the colors of the previewed components by using the color swatches placed below each component’s example in the documentation. Another great thing is that the kit provides design files for Sketch, Adobe XD, and Figma, so you can design and develop your project at the same time.
Tailwind Starter Kit is great for getting started very quickly and using it in fairly simple projects. However, if your project is more advanced and needs more components and options, then you should pick a more complex library.

10. Xtend UI
Xtend Ui Tailwind Css Component Library White And Light Blue Homepage With Description Of Library
Xtend UI is a powerful and flexible Tailwind CSS component library leveraging vanilla JavaScript. It’s most suitable for building interactive apps with advanced animations and interactions. Although the library uses vanilla JavaScript, it’s framework-agnostic, so you can use it with your favorite frontend framework. The library emphasizes accessibility, user experience, highly customizable design, and advanced interactivity.
Along with Tailwind CSS components, Xtend UI also provides UX themes that are focused more on user experience than design.
Simple animations are handled with CSS and Tailwind CSS variants, while the complex ones are handled using GSAP for JavaScript animations.
Xtend UI is a bit complex, making it most suitable for advanced interfaces. If this is your use case, then go for it. However, if your project is fairly simple, then you’re likely better off choosing a simpler library from this list.

11. daisyUI
DaisyUI Homepage
daisyUI offers semantic component classes that help reduce the verbosity of Tailwind utility classes while maintaining full customization capabilities.
What sets daisyUI apart is its approach to component styling. Instead of writing multiple utility classes like class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded", you can simply use class="btn btn-primary". This approach significantly reduces HTML complexity while still allowing you to override styles using Tailwind’s utility classes.
daisyUI has very customizable themes with over 32 prebuilt color themes and works with React, Vue, Svelte, and vanilla JavaScript. This is an extremely lightweight library (only 2KB) with full compatibility with Tailwind’s utility classes.
daisyUI is particularly well-suited for projects where you want to maintain Tailwind’s flexibility while reducing markup verbosity. It’s also great for teams transitioning from traditional component libraries to Tailwind CSS.
